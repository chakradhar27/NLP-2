# NLP-2 Project

## Text Classification with a Feed-Forward Neural Network.

The goal of this Project is to develop a Feedforward neural network for text classification from scratch using python. 

The task is to build a Neural Network model model to predict the topic using the Subset of AG News Corpus data. The detailed steps, code and the outcomes are discussed in the "FFN_Topic_Classification.ipynb" notebook
